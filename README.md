## User Card

This project implements a user card component that displays the number of tweets and followers for a user. The Follow button on the card can be clicked to increase the number of followers and change the text on the button to Following. Clicking the button again will decrease the number of followers and change the text back to Follow.

The state of the Follow button and the number of followers are stored. This means that even if the page is refreshed, the state of the button and the number of followers will be retained.
